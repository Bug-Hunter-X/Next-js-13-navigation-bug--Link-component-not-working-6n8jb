# Next.js 13 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a navigation bug in a Next.js 13 application.  The `Link` component from `next/link` does not correctly navigate to the `/about` page.

## Bug Description
The application has two pages: `Home` and `About`. The Home page contains a link to the About page using the `Link` component from `next/link`.  However, clicking the link does not navigate to the About page. Instead, it may just reload the home page or cause unexpected behavior. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's root directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Visit the `/` route (Home page).
2. Click on the link to navigate to the `/about` route.
3. Observe that navigation does not occur as expected.

## Solution
The issue might stem from incorrect usage of the `Link` component, or it could involve issues with routing configuration or conflicting packages. The solution usually involves verifying the `href` prop in the Link component, checking for any typos in the route, making sure the About.js is correctly placed within the pages directory, and ensuring that no conflicting routing configuration is present.
